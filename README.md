# StringSolution
This is yet another Codility code challenge that did not go well. 
The solution works (Intellij) but according to Codility it does not claiming there was an error formatted Actual vs Expected.
The target is to reverse the tokens in the String: "we test coders".
Expected: "ew tset sredoc".
Actual: "ew tset sredoc".
Codility response: There was an error.

The non-public that is to say the privately hosted Codility tasks for the paying companies and potential employers is a scam.
